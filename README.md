## Acknowledgements

This library is a port of [Bryan O'Sullivan's](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/)
[statistics](https://github.com/bos/statistics) library to node/javascript. This (Haskell)
library is friggin awesome and there is a lot to learn from it.

The configuration files and directory structure was taken from [Jos de Jong's](https://github.com/josdejong)
[mathjs](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) library. Once I get everything usable here, I would
definitely like to see the contents of this library get appropriated by mathjs.
